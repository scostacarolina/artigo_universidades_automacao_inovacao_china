I. General requirements
1. Basic situation
As technologies such as the internet, big data, cloud computing, and the internet of things have continued to develop, artificial intelligence has led to scientific 
and technological breakthroughs that are capable of causing a chain reaction and a number of disruptive technologies. It is accelerating the incubation of new 
drivers of economic development, shaping a new type of industrial system, and leading to a new scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation.
China is currently in the decisive stage of forming a well-off society in an all-round way. The people’s desire for a good life and the requirements for high-quality
economic development have created a bright future for the development and application of AI in China.
Artificial intelligence has characteristics that combine features of both the technical and the social. It is a new driver of economic development and an 
accelerator of social development. The capabilities of artificial intelligence, including big data-driven visual analytics, natural language understanding, and 
speech recognition are increasing rapidly. Business intelligence dialogue and recommendations, self-driving vehicles, smart wearables, language translation, 
automatic navigation, and new economic forecasting are quickly moving into a functional stage. AI technology is currently permeating and rebuilding the connections 
between the economic activities of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, creating new intelligentized (智能化) demands, products, technologies, 
ways of doing business from the macro to the micro level and changing the way we live down to our very social structure. This has created a spike in the overall 
productivity of our society. At the same time, innovative applications for artificial intelligence in education are accelerating. Using smart technology to innovate 
new ways to provide training, revolutionize teaching methods, improve academic administration, and build an intelligentized, networked, personalized, lifelong 
education system are important measures for promoting the development of balanced education, educational equity, and increased education quality. It is an 
indispensable driver of and support for educational modernization.
Colleges and universities are places where science and technology are the number one productive force, talent is the number one resource, and innovation is the 
number one driver.They have distinct features when it comes to the study and application of key technologies such as the basic theory of artificial intelligence, 
natural language understanding, computer vision, multimedia, robotics, etc., as well as a solid foundation when it comes to training people and the development of 
academic disciplines. Faced with the opportunity presented by new generation AI development, colleges and universities must further enhance their strengths in basic
research, the development of new disciplines, and training. They must intensify their applied basic research (应用基本研究) and increase breakthroughs in key 
general-purpose technologies. They must continuously promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence with the real economy in order to foster new drivers of
economic development. They must continuously promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence with the demands of the people in order to provide them with new
ways to improve their livelihoods. They must continuously promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence with education in order to provide new ways to 
revolutionize education. In doing so, they will lead China in scientific and technological innovation, training, and the demonstration of technical applications in 
the field of artificial intelligence, increasing the overall strength of AI in China.
2. Guiding ideology
